Audio To Notion is a powerful web application that transforms your audio recordings into structured Notion pages. It's designed to streamline the process of converting spoken content into organized, written notes.

## Current Features

- **Audio Upload**: Easily upload audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.) through a user-friendly interface.
- **Customizable Summaries**: Choose from multiple summary options:
  - Summary
  - Main Points
  - Action Items
  - Follow-up Questions
- **AI-Powered Processing**: Utilizes advanced AI to transcribe and summarize audio content.
- **Markdown Export**: Download your summarized content as a Markdown file.
- **Notion Import Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for manually importing the summary into Notion.

## How It Works


1. Upload your audio file.
2. Select your desired summary options.
3. Submit for processing.
4. Review and download the AI-generated summary.
5. Import the summary into Notion (currently manual).

## Future Goals

We're constantly working to improve Audio To Notion. Here are some exciting features on our roadmap:

### Direct Notion Integration

Our primary goal is to implement full Notion integration. This will allow:

- Automatic creation of Notion pages from processed audio.
- Direct insertion of summaries into user-specified Notion databases or pages.
- Customizable Notion templates for different types of audio content (meetings, lectures, interviews, etc.).

### Enhanced AI Capabilities

- Improved accuracy in transcription and summarization.
- Support for multiple languages.
- Speaker identification in multi-person recordings.

### User Experience Improvements

- Save user preferences for summary options.
- Batch processing of multiple audio files.
- Integration with popular cloud storage services for audio file selection.
